# PWA Text Editor

## Author: Thomas Stranick

## Description
The text editor PWA is an app that a user can enter text into the main text box and have it persist through storage and caching. The user can enter text, click out of the text box, and then refresh or close the page and the text will stay within the editor. This is achieved through service workers and caching, as well as IndexedDB. The user can also install the app using the install button on the top left of the screen which will prompt them to download it. If the user goes offline the page will exist due to caching as well.
